This application enables users to create and manage a **Healthy Habits** account. Upon registration, users' **BMI**, **daily EER**, and **DRI requirements** (based on USDA guidelines) are calculated and displayed on their personalized dashboard. Users can set and manage their **food** and **exercise goals** through dedicated tabs. Settings can be updated, and changes will reflect on their dashboard and goals. The app allows users to track food intake and exercises, which are recorded under their respective goals, and progress is shared under **Shared Updates** as goals are achieved.

Users can search for and connect with others by sending friend requests, which appear in **Pending Requests**. Once accepted, friends are listed under **Friends**, and they can view each other's shared progress.

This application is built using the **MEVN stack** (MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, and Node.js). 

### Features:
- **Personal Dashboard**: Displays BMI, EER, DRI, and goals.
- **Goal Management**: Set, update, and track food and exercise goals.
